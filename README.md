# SkipFFI

This is a [Skip](https://skip.tools) Swift/Kotlin library project that provides 
the capability for Skip's Kotlin transpiled code to call into C and C++ libraries
on Android.

On the Kotlin side, SkipFFI uses the Java Native Access ([JNA](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna))
library to simulate Swift types like `Swift.OpaquePointer` as `com.sun.jna.Pointer` pointer references, 
and implements `Swift.withUnsafeMutablePointer` using a `com.sun.jna.ptr.PointerByReference` on the Java side.

This capability is used by Skip frameworks like
[SkipSQL](https://source.skip.tools/skip-sql) and
[SkipScript](https://source.skip.tools/skip-script) to
provide a unified API to underlying native C APIs on both Darwin and Android.

## Example

```swift
#if !SKIP
import Darwin
#else
import SkipFFI
let Darwin = BionicDarwin()
#endif

// Full-qualified Module.fname() will call through SkipFFI to the C interface
Darwin.abs(-12) // 12
Darwin.free(Darwin.malloc(8))


// MARK: Implementation of C interface

func BionicDarwin() -> BionicDarwin {
    com.sun.jna.Native.load("c", (BionicDarwin.self as kotlin.reflect.KClass).java)
}

protocol BionicDarwin : com.sun.jna.Library {
    func abs(_ value: Int32) -> Int32

    func malloc(_ size: Int32) -> OpaquePointer
    func free(_ ptr: OpaquePointer) -> Int32

    func getenv(_ key: String) -> String?
}

```


## Implementation

SkipFFI's implementation provides:

```swift
public typealias OpaquePointer = com.sun.jna.Pointer
public typealias UnsafeMutableRawPointer = com.sun.jna.ptr.PointerByReference

public func withUnsafeMutablePointer<T>(to pointerRef: InOut<OpaquePointer?>, block: (UnsafeMutableRawPointer) throws -> T) rethrows -> T
```

## Working with Data

SkipFFI doesn't work with the Foundation Data API directly.

If you need to access raw bytes, you can use the APIs directly:

```swift

let blob = Data(â€¦)
let size = blob.count

#if SKIP
let buf = java.nio.ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(size)
buf.put(blob.kotlin(nocopy: true)) // transfer the bytes
let ptr = com.sun.jna.Native.getDirectBufferPointer(buf)
try check(code: SQLite3.sqlite3_bind_blob(stmnt, index, ptr, size, nil))
#else
try blob.withUnsafeBytes { ptr in
    try check(code: SQLite3.sqlite3_bind_blob(stmnt, index, ptr.baseAddress, size, nil))
}
#endif
```

## Embedded C Code

SkipFFI can be used to provide a direct interface from your transpiled Kotlin to
an embedded C library. It configures gradle's support for cmake build files and the
Android NDK toolchain to build the embedded C library for each of Android's supported
architectures, much in the same was as Xcode and SwiftPM handle building and linking
C source.

See the [Skip C Demo](http://source.skip.tools/skip-c-demo) sample project for an
example of using C files to provide a unified API to both Swift and Kotlin.


## Building

This project is a Swift Package Manager module that uses the
[Skip](https://skip.tools) plugin to transpile Swift into Kotlin.

Building the module requires that Skip be installed using 
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) with `brew install skiptools/skip/skip`.
This will also install the necessary build prerequisites:
Kotlin, Gradle, and the Android build tools.

## Testing

The module can be tested using the standard `swift test` command
or by running the test target for the macOS destination in Xcode,
which will run the Swift tests as well as the transpiled
Kotlin JUnit tests in the Robolectric Android simulation environment.

Parity testing can be performed with `skip test`,
which will output a table of the test results for both platforms.
